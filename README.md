# Enigma Machine Pocket Watch

This is the source code used in my Enigma Machine Pocket Watch project.

The original project is described here: [Enigma Machine Pocket Watch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210144402/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/2018/12/18/enigma-machine-pocket-watch-update)

A YouTube film of the watch is available here: [Enigma machine pocket watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB_8fjCkIWA)

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and uses external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine.

The code is very similar to my first Enigma machine watch with the addition of a RTC clock chip so it can actually keep time. I actually wear and use this watch most days.
